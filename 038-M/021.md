# `_etherPrice` could return 0 which would make the keepers not gain any incentive and lose the funds they used to pay gas
`_etherPrice` is using `latestRoundData` from Chainlink on the ETH/USD price feed to get the price of the ETH, that is then transformed into an `UFixed18` and used in `keep` to incentivize `keepers` to use specific function, by paying them some amount of `keeperToken`, but the amount payed can be 0 in some cases, which will make the `keepers` not gain anything and pay the for executing the transaction.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_etherPrice` uses Chainlink `latestRoundData` and doesn't do any checks for stale prices, which is already specified by the protocol, but it doesn't do any checks the the answer either. In general when you use priceFeeds from Chainlink it is a best practice to check if the `answer` got is greater than 0. In our case, since the function transforms the `answer` into a `UFixed18`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/attribute/Kept.sol#L63
it already checks for values smaller then 0 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/UFixed18.sol#L34
but it doesn't check for values equal to 0, which should be done. So in the case where the priceFeeds will return stale or wrong data and the `answer` will be 0, every check will pass and the value will then be passed into the calculations of the `keeperFee` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/attribute/Kept.sol#L46-L50
which will make the whole calculation be equal to 0. Because of that `keepers` will not gain any incentive, and they will lose the funds payed for gas.
## Impact
Medium since the losses are minimal.

## Recommendation
Even though the protocol doesn't have any special implementation of oracle/sequencers being down, it should be checked that the `answer` value is greater then 0, because if that is the case, the functionality will continue, but no incentivize will be given.
