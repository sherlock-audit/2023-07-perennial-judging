# Zero Asset Price Return in the `_getMarketPrice` Function
 The `_getMarketPrice()` function currently lacks a mechanism to handle a zero asset price returned by the Pyth Oracle, leading to potential data inaccuracies and program errors. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This function ` _getMarketPrice()` is used to retrieve the latest market price for a specific market from oracle. However,there's no mechanism in place to handle a situation where the price returned by the Pyth Oracle is 0. In most scenarios, it's impossible for an asset's price to be 0, so if the Oracle returns a price of 0, it's likely due to data error or other issues. This could lead to the following problems:
The price is used for trading and calculations, the results could be severely inaccurate, possibly leading to user losses or even manipulation.
```solidity
   function _getMarketPrice(IMarket market, address account) internal view returns (Fixed6 price) {
        (, OracleVersion memory latestVersion) = _latest(market, account);
        return latestVersion.price;
    }
```
