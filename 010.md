# Market creation is not permissionless as it is documented, instead onlyOwner can create Markets
## Summary
The idea behind perennial markets is to have permissionless markets for any asset that has an Oracle feed.
But the current design allows only the Owner of the Market factory to create new Markets using `create()` function 
## Vulnerability Detail

`onlyOwner`  prevents anyone that is not the owner to create Markets which results in permissioned markets design

## Impact

The [market creation](https://docs.perennial.finance/mechanism/market-structure#market-creation) as detailed in the documentation allows for [_permissionless_](https://docs.perennial.finance/overview#what-makes-perennial-special) market creation â€” anyone can come in and launch any market they desire. And it is one of the key things that makes perennial special.
## Code Snippet
The Vulnerable code is in `MarketFactory.sol` contract, here is the [snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/MarketFactory.sol#L64-L83):
```js
function create(IMarket.MarketDefinition calldata definition) external onlyOwner returns (IMarket newMarket) {
..
..
..
}
```

## Recommendation
Remove the modifier `onlyOwner` from `create()` function in MarketFactory contract
