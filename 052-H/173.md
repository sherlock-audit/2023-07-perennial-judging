# Stuck fees in `MarketFactory` as there is no function to withdraw them
## Summary
The `MarketFactory` claims fees from the `Market` in function `fund()`, which are stored in the `MarketFactory` contract. However, the fees have no way to be retrieved from the contract, leading to stuck funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Market` attributes fees to the `MarketFactory` via [`claimFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L134). It pushes the fees to the `MarketFactory` when the function is called by it (via [`fund()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/MarketFactory.sol#L87)).

Notice that function `fund()` does not send the received funds anywhere, nor is there another function to retrieve these funds, leading to stuck tokens.

## Impact
Stuck funds from fees in the `MarketFactory` contract.

## Code Snippet
Function `fund()` pulls the funds to the `MarketFactory`, but does not move them afterwards:
```solidity
    function fund(IMarket market) external {
        if (!instances(IInstance(address(market)))) revert FactoryNotInstanceError();
        market.claimFee();
    }
```
Function `claimFee()` pushes the funds to the respective receiver, which is the `MarketFactory` in this case:
```solidity
function claimFee() external {
    Global memory newGlobal = _global.read();

    if (_claimFee(address(factory()), newGlobal.protocolFee)) newGlobal.protocolFee = UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
    if (_claimFee(address(IMarketFactory(address(factory())).oracleFactory()), newGlobal.oracleFee))
        newGlobal.oracleFee = UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
    if (_claimFee(coordinator, newGlobal.riskFee)) newGlobal.riskFee = UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
    if (_claimFee(beneficiary, newGlobal.donation)) newGlobal.donation = UFixed6Lib.ZERO;

    _global.store(newGlobal);
}

/// @notice Helper function to handle a singular fee claim
/// @param receiver The address to receive the fee
/// @param fee The amount of the fee to claim
function _claimFee(address receiver, UFixed6 fee) private returns (bool) {
    if (msg.sender != receiver) return false;

    token.push(receiver, UFixed18Lib.from(fee));
    emit FeeClaimed(receiver, fee);
    return true;
}
```

## Tool used
Vscode, Hardhat, Manual Review

## Recommendation
Push the funds to the owner in the `fund()` function (syntax might be wrong):
```solidity
function fund(IMarket market) external { // TO SUBMIT cant withdraw
    if (!instances(IInstance(address(market)))) revert FactoryNotInstanceError();
    market.claimFee();
    incentive.push(owner, incentive.balanceOf());
}
```
