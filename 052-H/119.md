# fund() fee token be locked
in `MarketFactory.fund()`
the claimed `protocolFee` is stored in the contract.
but no method is provided to withdraw it, resulting in a permanent lock.

## Vulnerability Detail

in `MarketFactory.fund()` , it can claim `protocolFee` to `MarketFactory.sol`

```solidity
contract MarketFactory is IMarketFactory, Factory {
.....
    function fund(IMarket market) external {
        if (!instances(IInstance(address(market)))) revert FactoryNotInstanceError();
@>      market.claimFee();
    }
```

```solidity
contract Market is IMarket, Instance, ReentrancyGuard {
....
    function claimFee() external {
        Global memory newGlobal = _global.read();

@>      if (_claimFee(address(factory()), newGlobal.protocolFee)) newGlobal.protocolFee = UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
...
    }
```

From the above code, we can see that `fund()` will store the claim `protocolFee` in the contract.
But the `MarketFactory.sol` contract doesn't provide any way to withdraw it, so it's permanently locked in the contract.
Suggest `fund()` to transfer the `fee Token` directly to `MarketFactory.owner()`.

```solidity
contract MarketFactory is IMarketFactory, Factory {
...
    function fund(IMarket market) external {
        if (!instances(IInstance(address(market)))) revert FactoryNotInstanceError();
        market.claimFee();
+       market.reward().push(owner());
    }
