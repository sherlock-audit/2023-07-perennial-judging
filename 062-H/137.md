# `settle(address(0))` can result in incorrect `assets` and `shares` due to a miscalculation that mistakenly treats the global account as a local account.

## Vulnerability Detail

`settle()` is a public function that can be called by anyone at any time.

When called with `address(0)` as the `account` at L438-439, the global account `_accounts[address(0)]` will be copied as `context.global` and `context.local`.

Then, `context.global` will first get settled to the `latestIds` at L326, and a checkpoint will be saved.

Later at L342, `context.local` will be updated in `processLocal()`. However, it's actually processing the global account (`address(0)`) but in a "local" way, i.e., only `1/checkpoint.count` of the keeper fee will be applied.

Finally, in `_saveContext()`, the global copy and the local will be saved into storage at L447 and L448, where the local one will be the final one as it comes later.

## Impact

When `checkpoint.count > 1`, the `assets` and `shares` of the global account will be wrong.

## Recommendation

Local account settlement should be skipped when `settle(address(0))`.
