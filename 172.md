# Lack of update check for ETH/USD oracle allows the for use of outdated prices
## Summary

The lack of a check for the oracle data age for the keeper fee calculation can lead to fund loss for the protocol or the keeper. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The price oracle integration of the ETH/USD feed doesn't check for when the price feed was last updated, thus allowing old prices to be used in calculating keeper fees.

## Impact

In the case that the data from the price feed is not up-to-date anymore either the keeper or the protocol will lose funds in the form of a lower or higher keeper fee than supposed to.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// @audit the function's updatedAt output value doesn't get checked for age.
(, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
```

## Recommendation

Consider checking for whether the publish time of the prices is within appropriate staleness bounds similar to in this place in the protocol:
