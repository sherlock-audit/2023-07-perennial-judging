# Incorrect price calculation in PythOracle
## Summary

The price calculation in PythOracle is incorrect and can lead to prices being many orders of magnitudes higher than their actual price.

## Vulnerability Detail

`PythOracle._recordPrice` performs the following calculation:
```js
_prices[oracleVersion] = Fixed6Lib.from(price.price)
    .mul(Fixed6Lib.from(SafeCast.toInt256(10 ** SafeCast.toUint256(price.expo > 0 ? price.expo : -price.expo))));
```

The problem is that if the exponent is negative a division by 10^(abs(expo)) should be performed rather than a multiplication. See [PythNetwork-docs](https://docs.pyth.network/documentation/solana-price-feeds/best-practices)

## Impact

prices used for calculation in the protocol differ hugely from the prices reported by the oracle.

## Recommendation

Perform a division by 10^(abs(expo)) if expo is negative
