# Missing checks for whether Arbitrum Sequencer is active
## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the Arbitrum Sequencer goes down, the oracle data won't be updated, and can therefore become basic. However, users can continue to interact with the protocol directly through contracts
As a result, users may be able to use the protocol when the oracle feed is basic. This can cause a lot of problems, but as a simple example:

1): A user has an account with 100 tokens, each worth 1 ETH, and no loans
2): Sequencer Arbitrum temporarily shuts down
3): On the way down, the price of each token drops to 0.5 ETH
4): A user's current account value is 50 ETH, so they should be able to borrow a maximum of 200 ETH to keep the account healthy ((200 + 50) / 200 = 1.2)
5):Due to the floor price the protocol published they borrowed 400 ETH ( (400 + 100) / 400 = 1.2

## Impact
Stale prices, e.g. if USDC were to de-peg while the sequencer is offline, stale price is used and can result in false liquidation or over-borrowing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use sequencer oracle to determine whether the sequencer is offline or not, and don't allow orders to be executed while the sequencer is offline.
