# _etherPrice() in Kept.sol missing checking sequencer status on L2
Using Chainlink in L2 chains such as Arbitrum requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.
## Vulnerability Detail
`modifier keep` uses `_etherPrice()` for calculation `keeperFee`.
```solidity
  modifier keep(UFixed18 multiplier, uint256 buffer, bytes memory data) {
        uint256 startGas = gasleft();

        _;

        uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft();
        UFixed18 keeperFee = UFixed18Lib.from(gasUsed)
            .mul(multiplier)
            .add(UFixed18Lib.from(buffer))
            .mul(_etherPrice())
            .mul(UFixed18.wrap(block.basefee));

        _raiseKeeperFee(keeperFee, data);

        keeperToken().push(msg.sender, keeperFee);

        emit KeeperCall(msg.sender, gasUsed, multiplier, buffer, keeperFee);
    }
```
The _etherPrice() function is a  function in the Kept.sol contract that fetches the latest price data from a Chainlink price feed.
```solidity
 function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {
        (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
        return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); // chainlink eth-usd feed uses 8 decimals
    }
```
Also it's missing checking sequencer status on L2.
From [Chainlink documentation](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds):
Optimistic rollup protocols have a sequencer that executes and rolls up the L2 transactions by batching multiple transactions into a single transaction.
If a sequencer becomes unavailable, it is impossible to access read/write APIs that consumers are using and applications on the L2 network will be down for most users.
This means that if the project does not check if the sequencer is down, it can return stale results.

## Impact
Posible wrong calculation `keeperFee`  in  `modifier keep`

## Recommendation
Check L2 sequencer status and data staleness by time interval.
