# Inefficient Checks for Order Validity May Result in Insufficient Collateralization

## Summary

The contract includes multiple checks to ensure the validity of a given order. However, there are scenarios in which the cumulative effect of these checks can result in an order being accepted when it should not be, possibly leading to insufficient collateralization and consequential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_invariant` function in the Market.sol contract includes several checks to confirm the validity of an order. These checks evaluate the status of the order and its relation to the context, among other factors. Nevertheless, a critical issue arises from the condition checks in the latter part of the `_invariant` function.

If the order is not protected (`if (protected) return;`), the following code checks if the account can execute the order. However, it does not account for a scenario where the order might be empty but the collateral is negative, which might result in an invalid order being executed and subsequent consequences.

## Impact

In a scenario where this occurs, an order could be placed that the system deems valid, but which does not actually have sufficient collateral backing it. This could lead to vulnerabilities such as liquidations, losses for other participants in the market, and destabilization of the market as a whole.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _invariant(
        Context memory context,
        address account,
        Order memory newOrder,
        Fixed6 collateral,
        bool protected
    ) private view {

        // ...
        if (protected) return; // protection checks done, skip to operator checks 

        if (
            msg.sender != account &&                                                                        
            !IMarketFactory(address(factory())).operators(account, msg.sender) &&                           
            !(newOrder.isEmpty() && collateralAfterFees.isZero() && collateral.gt(Fixed6Lib.ZERO))     
        ) revert MarketOperatorNotAllowedError();

        // ... other conditions and checks 
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent insufficient collateralization, consider adding an additional check within the condition to evaluate if the order is empty and if the collateral is non-negative. This would ensure that only orders with sufficient collateral backing are executed.

## Proof Of Concept 

> assuming there is a mainnet fork environment:

1. Initialize an account with an operator that is not the sender.
2. Execute a function that calls `_invariant` with a new order that is empty but has a negative collateral.
3. The check for whether the sender is the account or operator will pass, despite the collateral being negative.
4. This can result in an order being executed without sufficient collateral, therefore leading to vulnerabilities in the market struct.

> While the exploit requires certain conditions, it represents a risk that should be mitigated. **Please note that the actual exploitation might require additional steps or conditions.**
