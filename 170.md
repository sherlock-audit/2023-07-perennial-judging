# Oracle requests are not limited to granularity
## Summary

Requests of oracle prices are not limited to the granularity set by the PythFactory. This will update the price feed much more frequently and cause the protocol to pay more rewards to keepers than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Oracle.request` requests price data from the provider everytime it is called:

```js
//Oracle
function request(address account) external onlyAuthorized {
    (OracleVersion memory latestVersion, uint256 currentTimestamp) = oracles[global.current].provider.status();

    oracles[global.current].provider.request(account);
...

// PythOracle (provider)
function request(address) external onlyAuthorized {
    if (versionList.length == 0 || versionList[versionList.length - 1] != block.timestamp) {
        versionList.push(block.timestamp); 
    }
```

The `PythFactory` defines a `_granularity` which is meant to limit the price updates to one update per granularity window. This intent has been confirmed by the sponsor, but the implementation has been missing in the `request` flow.


## Impact

Keepers update the price too frequently at cost of the protocol which has to pay keeper rewards

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either in `Oracle.request` or `PythOracle.request` perform a check if there has been a request already within the current granularity window and return early if so.
