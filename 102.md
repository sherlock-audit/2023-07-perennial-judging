# The use of a global latestNonce variable to generate order IDs is vulnerable to front-running attacks.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
This [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L413)   allows a malicious contract to observe new order transactions, increment latestNonce themselves first, and assign that nonce to their own fake order.
When the legitimate user tries to place their real order, it will get a nonce that is already taken by the attacker's fake order. This could prevent the real order from being placed or make it unexecutable later.

## Impact
Attacker can steal nonces or interfere with legitimate orders, as nonces are namespaced per account

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
nonces should be tracked per account, not globally
