# MultiInvoker is max approving any arbitrary address
## Summary
Multi-invoker is approving a target to spend all its tokens. Note that target is not restricted.

## Vulnerability Detail
Multinvoker has an `_approve` function which according to the natspec, is an "Helper to max approve DSU for usage in a market or vault deployed by the registered factories"
Here is the \_approve function:

```solidity
    function _approve(address target) internal {
        if(!marketFactory.instances(IInstance(target)) && !vaultFactory.instances(IInstance(target)))
            revert MultiInvokerInvalidApprovalError();
        DSU.approve(target);
    }
```

The problem is that, target can be any address, so anyone can call MultiInvoker#invoke, passing an Invocation with action "APPROVE", and set target to any address that is neither a vault or a market, and MultiInvoker will max approve that target to spend all its DSU tokens.
Now, whenever MultiInvoker gets some DSU tokens, that approved target will be able to call `DSU.transferFrom` to steal all DSU tokens from the MultiInvoker contract

## Impact

Anyone can make MultiInvoker.sol max approve any a=rbitrary address to spend all its DSU tokens

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict `_approve` function to be called only by an admin
