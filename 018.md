# Keeper can nor receive any fee for the executed job
## Summary
Keeper can nor receive any fee for the executed job, in case if calculated reward for him is bigger than fee in the order.
## Vulnerability Detail
User [can create orders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L408-L415) in the MultiInvoker contract.
Then keeper can execute this order and receive payment for the execution. It is calculated in the `Kept.keep` modifier and it [depends on several params](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/attribute/Kept.sol#L46-L50) as gas amount that was spent, `block.basefee`, and DSU/ETH price.
Once DSU amount to pay is calculated, then `_raiseKeeperFee` [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/attribute/Kept.sol#L52) to check if this amount is fine.

```solidity
    function _raiseKeeperFee(UFixed18 keeperFee, bytes memory data) internal override {
        (address account, address market, UFixed6 fee) = abi.decode(data, (address, address, UFixed6));
        if (keeperFee.gt(UFixed18Lib.from(fee))) revert MultiInvokerMaxFeeExceededError();


        IMarket(market).update(
            account,
            UFixed6Lib.MAX,
            UFixed6Lib.MAX,
            UFixed6Lib.MAX,
            Fixed6Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.from(-1, keeperFee), true),
            false
        );

    }
```
As you can see, in case if order fee is less than fee for the keeper then tx will revert. As result keeper will not receive any payment, however he paid for the tx that has reverted.
The reasons why such thing can occur in normal situations (when order creator provided enough fee) can be different. For example DSU price has increased in oracle or baseFee has increased as well.
## Impact
Keeper executed tx, spent gas, but didn't receive payment.

## Recommendation
I guess that in such cases, it's better to pay all amount that was provided as fee by user and not revert.
