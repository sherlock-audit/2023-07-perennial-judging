# invoke function will fail in cases where COMMIT_PRICE is used
## Summary

Multi Invoker helps to make batched calls to Perennial contracts . It has `invoke` function , which helps to perform different actions  in a single call.
But as per its use case, which is to handle multiple calls at once, if `COMMIT_PRICE` action is used multiple times in a single call, whole call to `invoke` function will revert.


## Vulnerability Detail
`COMMIT_PRICE` action calls  `_commitPrice` function internally.

Note , it transfers all the msg.value to the  oracle contract. This means , if there is another action `COMMIT_PRICE` lined up, it will fail as all the msg.value is used in the previous call. 

Hence , all the calls will revert . 
## Impact
`invoke` function calls will definitely revert every time `COMMIT_PRICE` is called 2 times  in a single call.

## Recommendation
Implement a way for the user able to send value for multiple actions in a single call.
