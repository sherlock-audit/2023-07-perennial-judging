# User cant add collateral to make his position healthy again, after being eligible for liquidation once
## Summary

Following an oracle update, a user can face liquidation when their maintenance surpasses the collateral amount.
As a result, anyone can initiate the liquidation process, closing the user's position and providing rewards to the liquidator. Presently, once a user is deemed insolvent, they lack the ability to add more collateral to avoid liquidation. This situation may lead to financial losses for the user and create unfair market conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail

When adding collateral, the user calls market update() with trade = 0 and some value for collateral.
Inside of _invaiant() there are several checks to ensure that the user cant open new positions or remove collateral.

```solidity
        if (
            !context.latestPosition.local.collateralized(context.latestVersion, context.riskParameter, collateralAfterFees)
        ) revert MarketInsufficientCollateralizationError();
```

Following check will always revert the transaction after user tries to add collateral, because the latestPosition is insolvent.

## Impact

When a user tries to add collateral, before he is liquidated, the transaction will revert. 

Because the oracle updates only a couple of minuets (Docs: https://docs.perennial.finance/mechanism/settlement)
there can be cases where a spike in the market causes the user to be insolvent for only a short amount of time, where it would make sense to add collateral to the position (which may already be solvent again), but because of slow update rate, the user would have to wait a long time, leading to unfair liquidation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify check to allow user to add collateral to make position solvent again.
This can be achieved in many ways, one could be to skip the reverting checks if collateral > 0 and newTrade = null.
