# collateralAfterFees does not subtract the fees for the current position
In the _loadPendingPositions() function. It calculates collateralAfterFees by subtracting the fees for pending positions up to but not including the current position. 

## Vulnerability Detail 
The _loadPendingPositions() function loads all the pending positions into memory for checking collateralization in _invariant(). It calculates collateralAfterFees by subtracting the fees from previous pending positions: [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L549-L558)

However, it does not subtract the fees for the current position, which is added separately [Link2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L559)

This allows a malicious actor to take a position that appears collateralized based on collateralAfterFees, but actually becomes undercollateralized once the current position's fees are applied.
For example:
•	Account collateral: 100 
•	Pending fee: 5 
•	Current position fee: 10 
collateralAfterFees would be 100 - 5 = 95 
The position would appear collateralized with 95 . But once the 10 current fee is applied, the true collateral is only 85.
This could allow an undercollateralized position to pass the collateralization check in _invariant().


## Impact
It allows a malicious actor to take a position that appears collateralized based on collateralAfterFees, but actually becomes undercollateralized once the current position's fees are applied.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_loadPendingPositions() should also subtract the current position's fees
