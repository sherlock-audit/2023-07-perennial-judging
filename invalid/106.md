# the _latestStale() check is vulnerable to timestamp manipulation by miners
## Summary
The _latestStale() check compares timestamps to determine if the latest oracle is stale. However, timestamps can be manipulated by miners to some extent. An attacker who is a miner could manipulate timestamps to trick the contract into thinking the latest oracle is stale when it is not
## Vulnerability Detail
This  [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/Oracle.sol#L112-L117) compares the timestamp from the latest oracle version to the timestamp when that version was committed. If the version timestamp is greater, it returns false.
A miner could manipulate this by:
1. Calling latest() to get the latest oracle version
2. Checking if _latestStale() would return true for that version
3. If so, mining a block with a timestamp that makes _latestStale() return false
4. Calling request() before the next miner mines a block, to update the oracle based on the manipulated timestamp
This would trick _latestStale() into thinking the latest oracle is not stale, when it actually is.

## Impact
An attacker can prevent the oracle from updating to the current provider when it should. They could manipulate the outdated oracle values.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
timestamps should not be fully trusted. Instead of comparing exact timestamps, have a buffer window of allowed timestamp drift
