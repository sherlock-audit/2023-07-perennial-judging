# Lack of validity and sanity checks while consuming Chainlink Oracle data
The project does not follow best practises in consuming Chainlink Oracle Price Feeds Data 
The result from Chainlink latestRoundData() are not validated or checked for integrity 

## Vulnerability Detail
The price received from latestRoundData() for the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token will be immediately used without any checks to the various other critical data returned from call. All other data for integrity checks  are ignored.

## Impact
(uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
This implies there are no checks for the following 
- if the price is zero
- if the data is stale 
- if the price may be incorrect or reasonable 
- if the round was complete 
Faulty prices, no prices, stale prices or zero prices impact working of protocol especially the critical incentives for the Keepers which are integral to the protocol 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
/// @notice Returns the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    /// @return The price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {
        (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
        return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); // chainlink eth-usd feed uses 8 decimals
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to perform checks for the returned data and ensure data validity and integrity by following the best practises of consuming Chianlinke Oracle Data here -> See 0xMacro how to consume Oracle Price Feeds Safely -> https://0xmacro.com/blog/how-to-consume-chainlink-price-feeds-safely/  
Checks recommended in link focus on price validity, roundId validity, timestamp validity, price not zero, price in reasonable deviation, storing last good values and staleness checks, circuit breaker suggestions  etc 

For example below checks can be made as a bare minimum ...

```solidity 
   (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 timestamp, uint80 answeredInRound) = ethTokenOracleFeed()latestRoundData();
        require(roundID !=  0, "Invalid");
        require(answeredInRound >= roundID, "Stale price");
        require(timestamp != 0,"Round not complete");
        require(answer > 0,"Chainlink answer reporting 0");
        ........
```
