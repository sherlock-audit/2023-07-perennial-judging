# Wrong implamatation of pythOracle request for using time.
PythOracleFactory use granularity for use price updates and push price according with that(for example if granularity is 15 minute than Oracle record price as 15 min parsels. However in PythOracle.request record it with block.timestamp instead of pythOracleFactory.current(). Because of that protocol will have unconsistencies because marketUpdate orders with PythOracleCurrent and there will be too much data collected in PythOracle.versionList array which is not intended.
