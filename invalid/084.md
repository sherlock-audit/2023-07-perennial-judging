# A malicious miner could manipulate prices to liquidate positions inappropriately
position liquidations in the _invariant function do not check for worst case loss scenarios
## Vulnerability Detail 
This  [Link ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L510-L512) only checks the current price, not a worst case price move

The _invariant function is used to verify that certain conditions are met before allowing a position update. This includes checking that the position is sufficiently collateralized.
However, it only checks the current collateralization based on the latest oracle price. It does not consider the worst case loss if the price were to move against the position.
A malicious miner could exploit this by:
1. Waiting for a victim to take a large, undercollateralized position.
2. In the same block, manipulate the oracle price to an extreme value that would cause the position to become hugely underwater.
3. Call update to liquidate the victim's position at the manipulated price.
