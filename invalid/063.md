# User is not allowed to reduce his position when it gets undercollateralized
## Summary
When a user's position becomes undercollateralized, user should be allowed to reduce his position size to avoid liquidation. But in the current implementation, the position is only allowed to be liquidated


## Vulnerability Detail
Within `Market#_invariant` function, there is this check:

```solidity
    if (
        !context.latestPosition.local.collateralized(context.latestVersion, context.riskParameter, collateralAfterFees)
    ) revert MarketInsufficientCollateralizationError();
```

In the case that user's position is undercollateralized, and he is trying to reduce it, the call will revert because even though the pendingPosition(i.e. current position after user reduced the position size) is collateralized, function is checking the former position size(which is undercollateralized, and is the reason why user is reducing position).

This prevents users from reducing his position size when it becomes undercollateralized.

## Impact
When a position becomes undercollateralized, the user is not allowed to reduce his position to make it healhy again.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can remove this check:

```solidity
    if (
        !context.latestPosition.local.collateralized(context.latestVersion, context.riskParameter, collateralAfterFees)
    ) revert MarketInsufficientCollateralizationError();
```

It is actually not needed because the for loop that follows adequately checks collateralization of pending positions(which is the required check to do).
Please explain if there are any other reasons for adding the check.
