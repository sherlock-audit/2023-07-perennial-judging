# Loss of Funds + Inconsistent Updates in AccountLib.processLocal
the vulnerability is in the way pending deposits and redemptions are processed and updated in both global and local contexts. When deposits and redemptions are processed, the processGlobal and processLocal functions are called. these functions modify the account's assets, shares, deposit, and redemption amounts based on the checkpoints., there is no mechanism to ensure synchronization between these updates and the global settlement flywheel updates.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable part of the code is within the processGlobal and processLocal functions, where pending deposits and redemptions are subtracted. Since these pending amounts are not being synchronized with the global settlement flywheel, it's possible for an attacker to manipulate the timing of these transactions, leading to a mismatch between the user settlement flywheel and the global settlement flywheel.
```solidity
  function processGlobal(
        Account memory self,
        uint256 latestId,
        Checkpoint memory checkpoint,
        UFixed6 deposit,
        UFixed6 redemption
    ) internal pure {
        self.latest = latestId;
        (self.assets, self.shares) = (
            self.assets.add(checkpoint.toAssetsGlobal(redemption)),
            self.shares.add(checkpoint.toSharesGlobal(deposit))
        );
        (self.deposit, self.redemption) = (self.deposit.sub(deposit), self.redemption.sub(redemption));
    }

    /// @notice Processes the position in a local context
    /// @param self The account to update
    /// @param latestId The latest position id
    /// @param checkpoint The checkpoint to process
    /// @param deposit The amount of pending deposits to clear
    /// @param redemption The amount of pending redemptions to clear
    function processLocal(
        Account memory self,
        uint256 latestId,
        Checkpoint memory checkpoint,
        UFixed6 deposit,
        UFixed6 redemption
    ) internal pure {
        self.latest = latestId;
        (self.assets, self.shares) = (
            self.assets.add(checkpoint.toAssetsLocal(redemption)),
            self.shares.add(checkpoint.toSharesLocal(deposit))
        );
        (self.deposit, self.redemption) = (self.deposit.sub(deposit), self.redemption.sub(redemption));
    }

    /// @notice Updates the account with a new order
    /// @param self The account to update
    /// @param currentId The current position id
    /// @param assets The amount of assets to deduct
    /// @param shares The amount of shares to deduct
    /// @param deposit The amount of pending deposits
    /// @param redemption The amount of pending redemptions

```
## Impact
an attacker can manipulate the timing of these transactions, leading to a mismatch between the user settlement flywheel and the global settlement flywheel resulting loss of fund

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My advise is to Implement a synchronization mechanism between pending deposits, redemptions, and the global settlement flywheel.
