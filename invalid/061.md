# Vault.sol: No slippage protection when claiming assets
## Summary
When users want to claim the assets that they've redeemed, they can call `Vault#update` with the amount of assets(`claimAssets`) that they want to claim.
Most of the time, users will receive less than the `claimAssets` they specified because claimAmount that the user will receive is determined through the `_socialize` function.
The PROBLEM is that, users are not allowed to specify the least amount of assets that they expect to receive, which can lead to them receiving far less tokens than they expected.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is `_update`:

```solidity
    function _update(
        Context memory context,
        address account,
        UFixed6 depositAssets,
        UFixed6 redeemShares,
        UFixed6 claimAssets
    ) private {
        ...
        UFixed6 claimAmount = _socialize(context, depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);
        ...
        asset.push(msg.sender, UFixed18Lib.from(claimAmount));
        ...
    }
```

and here is `_socialize`:

```solidity
    function _socialize(
        Context memory context,
        UFixed6 depositAssets,
        UFixed6 redeemShares,
        UFixed6 claimAssets
    ) private view returns (UFixed6 claimAmount) {
        if (context.global.assets.isZero()) return UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
        UFixed6 totalCollateral = UFixed6Lib.from(_collateral(context).max(Fixed6Lib.ZERO));
        claimAmount = claimAssets.muldiv(totalCollateral.min(context.global.assets), context.global.assets);
        if (depositAssets.isZero() && redeemShares.isZero()) claimAmount = claimAmount.sub(context.settlementFee);
    }
```

As we can see, claimAmount is recalculated, and may be different from `claimAssets`.
So claimAmount can be far less than user expected.

## Impact
Due to no slippage protection, users may receive far less tokens than they expected during claiming of assets

## Recommendation

Allow users to enter a `minClaimAmount` parameter in `Vault#update` when claiming assets
