# Gas `multiplier` should also apply to the `buffer`

## Vulnerability Detail

`multiplier` in the `keep` modifier is designed to be a premium applied to the gas used as an incentive for the keeper, and `buffer` is an amount to fix for the difference between the gas used tracked and the gas spent on the part that was untracked.

`multiplier` should be applied to the gas with the fix, otherwise it may end up with a suboptimal or even undesirable keeperFee amount -- think of a case that the `buffer` is much larger than the gas tracked (`gasUsed`), which means that buffer actually takes a large portion of the actual gas cost. If there is no premium on that part, the entire keeperFee may not be able to compensate for the actual gas cost.

```solidity
UFixed18 keeperFee = UFixed18Lib.from(gasUsed)
    .add(UFixed18Lib.from(buffer))
    .mul(multiplier)
    .mul(_etherPrice())
    .mul(UFixed18.wrap(block.basefee));
