# the collateral checkpointing logic is vulnerable to miner/validator manipulation
The collateral checkpointing logic in _checkpointCollateral() retroactively updates the collateral on the latest position based on fees/rewards incurred after that position snapshot. 
## Vulnerability Detail 
The key issue is that _checkpointCollateral() retroactively modifies already committed state (the collateral level on the latest position).
This allows a miner/validator to manipulate the state transition as follows:
1. Miner includes a user transaction that incurrs a loss
2. latestPosition snapshot occurs, saving the old collateral level
3. Loss transaction processes, reducing the user's collateral
4. Miner includes one or more transactions for the user that realize PnL gains
5. Gains increase the user's context.local.collateral balance
6. Miner includes liquidation transaction for the user
7. _checkpointCollateral() executes as part of liquidation, modifying latestPosition.collateral to subtract out the gain from step 4
8. This makes the user appear solvent again, preventing liquidation


## Impact
This exploits the fact that miners/validators control transaction ordering and can manipulate state changes across transactions

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
• Remove the collateral adjustment logic completely
• Only subtract fees/rewards up to the current block timestamp, not future pending positions
