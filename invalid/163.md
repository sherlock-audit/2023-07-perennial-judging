```solidity
    function register(IOracleProviderFactory factory) external onlyOwner {
        factories[factory] = true;
        emit FactoryRegistered(factory);
    }


    /// @notice Authorizes a factory's instances to request from this contract
    /// @param caller The factory to authorize
    function authorize(IFactory caller) external onlyOwner {
        callers[caller] = true;
        emit CallerAuthorized(caller);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Instead of setting true in both of the functions, use a bool flag to update the permission.
This will give control over these two elements.
