# owner can repeatedly call the update() function to waste gas
There is no check that the new oracle provider passed to update() is different from the current one. This could allow the owner to repeatedly update to the same oracle to waste gas. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The oracles mapping stores the history of oracle providers. Each time update() is called, _updateCurrent() increments global.current and adds a new entry to the oracles mapping with the newProvider.
This will emit an OracleUpdated event and modify storage even if newProvider is the same as the current provider.
A malicious owner could call this in a loop to waste gas.

## Impact
Wasted gas costs, increased storage costs, spamming the oracle, manipulating timestamps and confusing off-chain processes
