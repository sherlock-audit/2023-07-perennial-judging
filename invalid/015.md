# Vault doesn't have market limit which can dos vault
## Summary
Vault doesn't have market limit which can dos vault
## Vulnerability Detail
Owner of `Vault` contract [can register markets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L142-L151), that Vault works with. Currently there is no aby restriction on the amount of registered markets.

The problem is that in case if big amount of markets will be added, then contract will not be able to operate as it's [looping through the all markets](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L413) and executes needed operations. Each market increases amount of gass that is needed to execute action. As result at some point amount of markets will be big enough, so tx will not fit into block gas limit. As there is no ability to remove market, then vault will not be able to interact with any market anymore.
## Impact
