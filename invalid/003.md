# Missing zero address validations in `Vault.sol` for asset initialization and account parameters in `settle` & `update` functions risking uninitialized state and fund mismanagement

The `Vault.sol` smart contract does not contain a check for zero addresses during initialization and several function calls. It allows for interaction with zero addresses that could actually lead to critical bugs, enabling attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) or loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `initialize` function of the `Vault.sol` contract, the `asset_` parameter is set as the `asset` state variable without first checking whether `asset_` is a zero address. This could lead to an uninitialized `asset` state variable if `asset_` is passed as a zero address during contract initialization.

Moreover, the contract does not validate that the `account` address parameter in `settle` and `update` functions is a non-zero address. This opens up the possibility for an attacker to interact with these functions using a zero address, leading to incorrect calculations or even loss of funds.

Here's the relevant code:

```solidity
function initialize(
 Token18 asset_,
 IMarket initialMarket,
 string calldata name_
 ) external initializer(1) {
 __Instance__initialize();

 asset = asset_;
 _name = name_;
 _register(initialMarket);
 }

function settle(address account) public whenNotPaused {
 _settleUnderlying();
 Context memory context = _loadContext(account);

 _settle(context);
 _manage(context, UFixed6Lib.ZERO, false);
 _saveContext(context, account);
 }

function update(
 address account,
 UFixed6 depositAssets,
 UFixed6 redeemShares,
 UFixed6 claimAssets
 ) external whenNotPaused {
 _settleUnderlying();
 Context memory context = _loadContext(account);

 _settle(context);
 _checkpoint(context);
 _update(context, account, depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);
 _saveContext(context, account);
 }
```

## Impact

An attacker could possibly exploit these vulnerabilities to trigger unexpected behavior in the contract, leading to incorrect calculations or even loss of funds. A zero address used as an account could also result in tokens being irretrievably locked within the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function initialize(
 Token18 asset_,
 IMarket initialMarket,
 string calldata name_
 ) external initializer(1) {
 __Instance__initialize();

 asset = asset_;
 _name = name_;
 _register(initialMarket);
 }

function settle(address account) public whenNotPaused {
 _settleUnderlying();
 Context memory context = _loadContext(account);

 _settle(context);
 _manage(context, UFixed6Lib.ZERO, false);
 _saveContext(context, account);
 }

function update(
 address account,
 UFixed6 depositAssets,
 UFixed6 redeemShares,
 UFixed6 claimAssets
 ) external whenNotPaused {
 _settleUnderlying();
 Context memory context = _loadContext(account);

 _settle(context);
 _checkpoint(context);
 _update(context, account, depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);
 _saveContext(context, account);
 }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before assigning the `asset` variable in the `initialize` function or calling the `settle` and `update` functions with the `account` address, implement a check to verify that the passed addresses are non-zero.

## Proof Of Concept

A demonstration of an attack exploiting this vulnerability might look like this:

1. An attacker calls the `initialize` function passing the zero address as `asset_`.
2. This results in an uninitialized `asset` state variable.
3. Similarly, the attacker calls `settle` or `update` with the zero address, leading to incorrect calculations or loss of funds.

> In a local or testnet environment, these steps would likely demonstrate the vulnerability:

```javascript
// Initialize contract with zero address as asset
await contract.initialize('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', initialMarket, 'TestVault');

// Call settle function with zero address
await contract.settle('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000');

// Call update function with zero address
await contract.update('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);
```

**These calls should fail if the contract has appropriate checks in place for zero addresses, but in this case, they would succeed.**
