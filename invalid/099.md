# Uncapped MaxClaim Increament
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/OracleFactory.sol#L85-L88
Despite having trusted admin, it is still necessary to have some admin previledged in check to prevent distrust from some technical users who might seek deeper understanding of how the protocol works. 

In OracleFactory.sol, onlyOwner has the previledge of updateing the maxClaim, while this might be important, I believe there should be a no go limit even by the factory deployer who is presumed to be trusted. 

This uncapped upgrade leaves a possibility to steal value by increasing the maxClaim to the highest limit

## Vulnerability Detail
Check summary.

## Impact
In order to claim incentive token, checks in place include;
```solidity
  if (amount.gt(maxClaim)) revert OracleFactoryClaimTooLargeError();
  if (!factories[IOracleProviderFactory(msg.sender)]) revert OracleFactoryNotRegisteredError();
```
all onlyOwner needs to do is to increase the maxClaim amount and register a fraudulent OracleProvider that will make claims to exorbitant reward incentive token for a single price update. 

The ultimate impact to this is that informed/technical users could see this a way the protocol could stylishly steal value while appearing fair.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function updateMaxClaim(UFixed6 newMaxClaim) external onlyOwner {
        maxClaim = newMaxClaim;
        emit MaxClaimUpdated(newMaxClaim);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual review


## Recommendation
Consider having a constant variable that must not be exceeded, with that,  it is open to everyone what the maxClaim could be set to in worst case scenario.
