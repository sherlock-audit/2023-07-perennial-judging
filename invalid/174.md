# Possible reentrancy with claimReward() function
## Summary

When the sender tries to call claimReward() function, it can trigger a reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

When the sender calls claimReward() function, it fetches the memory locally and checks if the sender has a valid reward. And this reward is sent to the sender. Also, since the transmission of the reward occurs before it is written to memory, this can be an opportunity for reentrancy attacks.

## Impact

Loss of funds. This may result in loss of rewards in the contract.
