# PythOracle.commitRequested can be frontrunned
PythOracle.commitRequested can be frontrunned
## Vulnerability Detail
PythOracle contract incentivizes keepers to provide oracle price to the contract [by calling `commitRequested`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/pyth/PythOracle.sol#L124C14-L124C29) and receive reward for that. In order to provide price, keepers should fetch it, which means that they should do some additional work, not just trigger `commitRequested` function.

The problem is that anyone can frontrun this call and use same data that original keeper has collected and just reuse it and receive payment for not doing price collecting. This is possible on L2 chains that has or will have mempool. I include this bug, because any ethereum l2 is in the scope in the readme.
## Impact
Keeper loose rewards, keppers are not incentivized to collect prices.
