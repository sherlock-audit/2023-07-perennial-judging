# Redundant oracle version update in `Oracle.sol` given unchecked `newProvider` version in `_updateCurrent` function results in superfluous gas costs and misleading event emissions
## Summary

In the Oracle.sol contract, the function `_updateCurrent(IOracleProvider newProvider)` is used to update the current version of the oracle. However, it does not adequately validate whether the new version is truly valid, nor does it correctly verify if the new version differs from the current one.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `_updateCurrent(IOracleProvider newProvider)` doesn't check whether the new provider version differs from the current version before the update. A malicious owner may intentionally or mistakenly update the current version with the same version again.

## Impact

If the current version of the oracle is updated with the same version, it may cause unnecessary computation and event emission, which in turn may cause unnecessary gas consumption for the transaction. Additionally, a user relying on event logs to track version changes may get misleading information due to the duplicate update events.

## Code Snippet

In Oracle.sol:

```solidity
 function _updateCurrent(IOracleProvider newProvider) private {
  if (global.current != global.latest) revert OracleOutOfSyncError();
  oracles[uint256(++global.current)] = Epoch(newProvider, uint96(newProvider.current()));
  emit OracleUpdated(newProvider);
 }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a check to ensure that the new provider version is different from the current version before performing the update:

```solidity
function _updateCurrent(IOracleProvider newProvider) private {
 if (newProvider.current() == global.current) revert SameOracleVersionError();
 if (global.current != global.latest) revert OracleOutOfSyncError();
 oracles[uint256(++global.current)] = Epoch(newProvider, uint96(newProvider.current()));
 emit OracleUpdated(newProvider);
}
```

## Proof Of Concept

> To simulate the above vulnerability's exploitation:

1. Start a local Ethereum testnet using Ganache or Hardhat.
2. Deploy the Oracle.sol contract and initialize it with an `IOracleProvider` instance.
3. Note down the current version of the oracle.
4. Call the `update(IOracleProvider newProvider)` function with the same `IOracleProvider` instance.
5. Check the event logs, you will see that a `OracleUpdated` event is emitted even though the version hasn't changed. 

> Note that this PoC is based on the assumption that **the entity that's performing the exploit has the necessary control over the Oracle contract to accomplish the steps mentioned above.** 

**The primary goal is to illustrate the flaw and show how it can be exploited. As a real-life attack may be subject to more complex conditions and prerequisites, therefore should consider this example as a simplified version of a possible attack scenario.**
