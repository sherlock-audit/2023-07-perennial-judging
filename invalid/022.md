# `_unwrap` in `MultiInvoker.sol` can revert every time in some cases which will make the users not being able to `_liquidate` or `_withdraw` with `warp` to true
`_withdraw` makes some wrong assumptions which could lead to reverts all the time if `DSU` protocol will be in debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_withdraw` is called in `_liquidate`, `_vaultUpdate` and  `_update`, and if the `wrap` is set to true, which will be all the time in the case of `_liquidate`, it will try to call `_unwrap` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L262
After that `_unwrap` will check if the address of `batcher` is 0, which can be the case if it is not set up in the constructor, or if the `balanceOf`  USDC of `batcher` is less than the amount intended to withdraw 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L287
and if any of that will be true it will try to call the `redeem` function on `reserve` with the intended amount 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L288
and then transfers the `amount` to the `receiver`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L289
The problem relies in the fact that the protocol assumes that the `amount` that is used in `redeem` function will always be equal to the `amount` of USDC returned, which is not the case.
As can be seen in the code of the `reserve` here the `redeemAmount` is a calculation that depends on the `redeemPrice` which depends on the debt of the protocol 
https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/c5d876fbd8ff1fac988898b77ef5461971f9fdd2/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveComptroller.sol#L125
The whole calculation of `redeemPrice` is done depending of the `reserveRatio` of the Protocol 
https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/c5d876fbd8ff1fac988898b77ef5461971f9fdd2/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveComptroller.sol#L81-L84
 so in the case where DSU will make some bad decisions and it will be in debt the `redeemAmount` calculated will be less than the actual amount inserted into `redeem` function, and that `redeemAmount` will be the one actual transferred to the `MultiInvoker.sol`
https://github.com/emptysetsquad/emptyset/blob/c5d876fbd8ff1fac988898b77ef5461971f9fdd2/protocol/contracts/src/reserve/ReserveComptroller.sol#L130
So when `_unwrap` will try to transfers the same amount of USDC 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L289
the transaction would revert because the contract would not have enough USDC in the contract, making `_vaultUpdate`, `_update` with `warp` to true on `_withdraw` reverting all the time and `_liquidate` reverting 100% of the time. Since the protocol stated that they want to be aware of any issue that might arise with the integration of DSU

I decided to specify this issue which could happen can cause a lot of damage to the users.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since it will cause the liquidation process to fail and also withdrawing funds to fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the contract doesn't store any USDC, you could transfer the whole balance of the contract every time after you call `redeem` or do balance before and balance after, and transfer the difference. It is important to take special care when you implement other protocols since any failures will also break your protocol.
