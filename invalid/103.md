# integer underflow vulnerability due to the use of uint96 for storing timestamps.
There is a potential integer underflow vulnerability due to the use of uint96 for storing timestamps.
## Vulnerability Detail
This  [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/Oracle.sol#L78) casts the uint256 timestamp returned by newProvider.current() into a uint96, which can cause underflow if the timestamp is greater than 2^96 - 1. 
Here [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/Oracle.sol#L68) a uint256 timestamp is compared against a uint96 stored timestamp. If underflow occurred, this comparison may not work as expected. 

A vulnerable exploit would be:
1.	Deploy a malicious oracle that returns a timestamp of 2^256 - 1
2.	Call update() to set this oracle
3.	The uint96 timestamp will underflow to 0
4.	Call at() with a timestamp between 0 and 2^96 - 1. It will incorrectly return the latest value instead of reverting.
This allows an attacker to manipulate the return values of at().

## Impact
An attacker could trick the contract into using incorrect historical values for critical operations like pricing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Use uint256 instead of uint96 for storing timestamps
2. Explicitly cast timestamps to uint256 before comparisons:
