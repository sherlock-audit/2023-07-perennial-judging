# PythOracle stores prices incorrectly
PythOracle stores prices incorrectly as it doesn't scale price received from the oracle
## Vulnerability Detail
`PythOracle` is created for a specific token. When price is recorded, then `_recordPrice` function is called.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/pyth/PythOracle.sol#L201-L205
```solidity
    function _recordPrice(uint256 oracleVersion, PythStructs.Price memory price) private {
        _prices[oracleVersion] = Fixed6Lib.from(price.price)
            .mul(Fixed6Lib.from(SafeCast.toInt256(10 ** SafeCast.toUint256(price.expo > 0 ? price.expo : -price.expo))));
        _publishTimes[oracleVersion] = price.publishTime;
    }
```
`PythStructs.Price` is the struct from solidity sdk of pyth oracle. This struct contains `price`, which is scaled with `expo` value.
As you can see, `_prices` stores prices in Fixed6 and `price.price` is converted to the Fixed6(but price is scaled by expo now), and then this value is scaled with expo.
The problem is that unscaled `price.price` should be converted to Fixed6.
## Impact

## Recommendation
You need to convert unscaled `price.price` to Fixed6.
