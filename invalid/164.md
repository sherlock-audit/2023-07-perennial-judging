# Eth oracle feed not updateable in Kept

The ETH oracle feed used in kept is not changeable. If it ever gets shutdown, prices used for keeper fees will diverge from market price and can cause over-/underpayment.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Kept` the `_ethTokenOracleFeed` is set once, during initialization and can not be changed by owner after that:

```js
function __UKept__initialize(
    AggregatorV3Interface ethTokenOracleFeed_,
    Token18 keeperToken_
) internal onlyInitializer {
    _ethTokenOracleFeed.store(address(ethTokenOracleFeed_));
```

If this feed gets stale or gets shutdown, the price read in `etherPrice` (used to determine keeper reward) will diverge from the actual market price.

## Impact

Over-/underpayment due to stale and not updateable oracle.
