# Code can lock funds by approving the batcher and reserve without a way to revoke approval
The code does approve the batcher and reserve to transfer tokens via approve(), and there is no way to revoke that approval. This can potentially lock funds if the batcher or reserve is malicious
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no way to revoke the approval after it has been granted. The standard ERC20 approve() method only allows setting the approval amount, not revoking it.
## Impact
If either the batcher or reserve is malicious, they could potentially drain all the DSU and USDC tokens from this contract, locking the funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract could use the ERC20 increaseAllowance() and decreaseAllowance() methods to carefully control the approval amounts rather than approving the maximum amount.
It could also revoke approvals when no longer needed by setting the approval to 0:
