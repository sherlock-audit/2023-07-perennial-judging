# Unable to withdraw funds if `wrap` is true

## Summary
If the `wrap` flag is set to true, users cannot withdraw funds from the `perennial-v2\packages\perennial-extensions\contracts\MultiInvoker.sol` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_withdraw` function in the `perennial-v2\packages\perennial-extensions\contracts\MultiInvoker.sol` contract only allows users to withdraw DSU tokens when the `wrap` flag is set to true. However, it does not allow users to withdraw USDC tokens. This means that users who want to withdraw USDC tokens must first set the `wrap` flag to false.

This vulnerability is a problem because it prevents users from withdrawing their funds if they need them in USDC. Additionally, it could also lead to users losing their funds if the DSU token price drops significantly.
```solidity
    /// @notice Push DSU or unwrap DSU to push USDC from this address to `account`
    /// @param account Account to push DSU or USDC to
    /// @param amount Amount to transfer
    /// @param wrap flag to unwrap DSU to USDC
    function _withdraw(address account, UFixed6 amount, bool wrap) internal {
        if (wrap) {
            _unwrap(account, UFixed18Lib.from(amount));
        } else {
            DSU.push(account, UFixed18Lib.from(amount));
        }
    }
```
This function is used in [_liquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L218-L234), [_vaultUpdate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L187-L216) and [_update](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L164-L185) which ultimately mess the working of [invoke](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L108-L162) function in `perennial-v2\packages\perennial-extensions\contracts\MultiInvoker.sol`

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could be significant. If users cannot withdraw their funds, they may lose access to their money. Additionally, if the DSU token price drops significantly, users could lose even more money.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommended mitigation for this vulnerability is to add a check to the _withdraw function to see if the wrap flag is set to true. If it is, the function should also withdraw the equivalent amount of USDC tokens. This would allow users to withdraw their funds in either DSU or USDC, depending on their preference.

The following code snippet shows how to implement this mitigation:
```solidity
if (wrap) {
    USDC.push(account, amount);
    _unwrap(account, UFixed18Lib.from(amount));
}
```
