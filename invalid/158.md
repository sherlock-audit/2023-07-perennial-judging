# Past rewards should be settled before changing makerRewardRate / longRewardRate / shortRewardRate

## Vulnerability Detail

The reward parameters (makerRewardRate / longRewardRate / shortRewardRate) can be changed by the owner with the `updateParameter()` function.

The change will be effective immediately, for example, the owner can change all the 3 RewardRates (`makerRewardRate / longRewardRate / shortRewardRate`) to 0.

For the users with unsettled pending rewards, they will lose them all.
