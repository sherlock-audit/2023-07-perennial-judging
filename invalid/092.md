# _retarget function in the Vault contract is vulnerable to price manipulation from the oracles of the registered markets
The _retarget function does rely on latestPrice from the market's oracle, which could potentially be manipulated
## Vulnerability Detail
the _retarget function in the Vault contract is vulnerable to price manipulation from the oracles of the registered markets.
The key parts of _retarget are [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L391-L400)

This calls the update function on the market, passing in the new target position and collateral amounts calculated by the vault's strategy. The problem is that target is calculated based on latestPrice from the market's oracle [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L424) & [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L359-L363)



## Impact
The latestPrice can be manipulated by the oracle. By reporting a fake price, the oracle can trick the vault into putting more collateral into the market than it should based on the real price. This could allow an attacker to drain collateral from the vault by manipulating prices.

## Recommendation
the Vault contract should not rely solely on the price from the market's oracle
