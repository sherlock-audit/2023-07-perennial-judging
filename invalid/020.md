# `from` function in `Fixed6.sol` and `Fixed18.sol` makes wrong assumptions which could lead to overflow
The wrong assumptions of the `from` in `Fixed6.sol` and `Fixed18.sol` function could lead to overflows which could cause reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is specified in the NatSpec of the two `from` functions that `from(m)` multiplies `m` by `BASE` and cannot be `type(256).min`  as can be seen here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed6.sol#L49-L51
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed18.sol#L49-L51
assumptions which are not correct because `from(m)` here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed18.sol#L52
will not be passed into the `from` function that has the argument an `int256` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed18.sol#L62-L64
the one that will be multiplied by `BASE`, it will be passed into the `from` function which takes an `UFixed18` as argument
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed18.sol#L34-L38
because `m` in this case will be an `UFixed18` type value, function which will just transform an `uint256` to an `int256`, and it will check that the `value` is not greater than `type(int256).max`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/number/types/Fixed18.sol#L36
The problem relies in the fact that since it checks only for greater values, `value` can be equal to `type(int256).max` which negated will be `type(int256).min`, so by wrapping this `value`, it could lead to underflows and reverts in the code most of the time.

## Impact
Medium impact since it could break the logic of the code and lead to reverts

## Recommendation
Take special care for this case since the assumption made in the comments are wrong and could lead to malfunctioning in the code.
