# User may not be able to withdraw funds from the `Vault` (account freeze) due to `minPosition` limit

## Vulnerability Detail

A `_positionLimit()` will be applied to limit the minimum position that a market must maintain in the `StrategyLib#allocate()` function.

For a market with a gap between major and minor greater than the entire maker, it does not allow any deallocation from such a market.

This means that a Vault that invested in a skewed market CANNOT withdraw the funds even if the users wish to, which is equivalent to an account freeze for all the Vault users.

In contrast, a retail user with a long/short/maker position is allowed to stop loss and close the position at their discretion.

## Impact

Vault users are forced to keep their position against the major players in the markets until the vault's position on such a market gets liquidated.
