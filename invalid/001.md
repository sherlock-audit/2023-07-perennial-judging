# Bypass of caller authentication in `MultiInvoker.sol` caused from absence of `msg.sender` verification in `invoke()` and `_executeOrder()` functions allows unauthorized order execution

A critical security issue was identified in the MultiInvoker.sol contract. More specifically, it was observed that the function `invoke()` allows for unauthorized order execution if specific conditions are met. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the MultiInvoker.sol contract, the function `invoke()` serves as a gateway to execute multiple actions based on the `PerennialAction` enum. However, the `_executeOrder()` function, which is called from the `invoke()` function when `PerennialAction` is `EXEC_ORDER`, lacks adequate permission checks. 

The `_executeOrder()` function can be called without verifying the identity of the caller, meaning anyone could possibly execute any order as long as they know the account, market, and nonce related to the order. The absence of an explicit permission check against the `msg.sender` opens a vector for unauthorized execution of orders. 

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is high. Attackers could eventually execute orders that do not belong to them, leading to a disruption in the normal flow of operations and possible financial loss for the users whose orders are being executed.

## Code Snippet

In the MultiInvoker.sol contract:

```solidity
function _executeOrder(
 address account,
 IMarket market,
 uint256 nonce
 ) internal keep (
 UFixed18Lib.from(keeperMultiplier),
 GAS_BUFFER,
 abi.encode(account, market, orders(account, market, nonce).fee)
 ) {
 if (!canExecuteOrder(account, market, nonce)) revert MultiInvokerCantExecuteError();

 Position memory currentPosition = market.pendingPositions(account, market.locals(account).currentId);
 orders(account, market, nonce).execute(currentPosition);

 market.update(
 account,
 currentPosition.maker,
 currentPosition.long,
 currentPosition.short,
 Fixed6Lib.ZERO,
 false
 );

 delete _orders[account][market][nonce];
 emit OrderExecuted(account, market, nonce, market.locals(account).currentId);
 }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a permission check within the `_executeOrder()` function, ensuring that the `msg.sender` is authorized to execute the order. This could involve a comparison between `msg.sender` and `account` to ensure that they match. 

```solidity
if (account != msg.sender) revert MultiInvokerUnauthorizedError();
```

## Proof Of Concept

> The following steps describe how the vulnerability could be exploited:

1. Prepare a local setup with a fork of the main Ethereum network using Hardhat.
2. Deploy the MultiInvoker contract and the required dependencies (market, token contracts etc).
3. Use an account to place an order in the market by calling the `invoke()` function with the `PerennialAction.PLACE_ORDER` action.
4. Obtain the nonce for this order.
5. Using a different account, call the `invoke()` function with the `PerennialAction.EXEC_ORDER` action, passing the first account address, the market address and the obtained nonce as arguments.

**Now, the second account would be able to execute the order placed by the first account, demonstrating the possible unauthorized order execution.**
