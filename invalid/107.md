# the at() function can be exploited to cause an out-of-gas error
The at() view function iterates backwards through historical oracles to find the right one for the timestamp. This could be exploited to cause the function to run out of gas if there are a large number of historical oracles. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that it iterates from global.current downwards without any limit on the number of iterations.
An attacker could exploit this by:
1. Calling update() multiple times to add a large number of historical oracles to the oracles mapping
2. Calling at() with a very old timestamp that requires iterating through most/all of the oracles
3. This will cause the at() function to iterate over a very large number of oracles, potentially using up all available gas and reverting

## Impact
This will cause the function to run out of gas

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
oracles should be stored in a more efficient data structure like a binary search tree rather than a simple mapping.
