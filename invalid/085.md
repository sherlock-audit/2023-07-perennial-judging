# updateBeneficiary function allows the owner to divert funds by changing where fees and donations are sent
The updateBeneficiary function allows the owner to change the beneficiary address, which is where any donation fees will be sent when claimed via the claimFee function.
## Vulnerability Detail
By changing the beneficiary, the owner can divert donation fees to any address they want. This could allow them to improperly take funds from the protocol.

## Impact
It compromises the integrity of the protocol by allowing the owner to take funds meant for donations or  improperly profit from donation fees that were intended for a different beneficiary
