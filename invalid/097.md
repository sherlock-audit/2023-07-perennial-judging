# ````keeperFee```` may be Insufficient due to implicit assumption of ````DSU```` price
There is an implicit assumption of DSU price to be ````$1```` USD while calculating ````keeperFee````. Though DSU is 1:1 backed by USDC, but USDC itself is not strictly worth ````$1````. Actually, just a few months ago, there was a significant depegging between USDC and USD. Hence, pay of ````keeperFee```` may be insufficient while depegging occurs. Keepers would get no enough premium or even lead to loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
First, let's look at L46~50, the calculation  result is ````keeperFee ```` amount of USD. Then, we look at L54, ````keeperFee ```` amount of DSU is sent to keeper with implicit assumption of ```` 1 USD = 1 DSU````. But, if DSU depegs, then ````1 USD > 1 DSU````, keepers receive insufficient fee.
```solidity
File: root\contracts\attribute\Kept.sol
40:     modifier keep(UFixed18 multiplier, uint256 buffer, bytes memory data) {
41:         uint256 startGas = gasleft();
42: 
43:         _;
44: 
45:         uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft();
46:         UFixed18 keeperFee = UFixed18Lib.from(gasUsed)
47:             .mul(multiplier)
48:             .add(UFixed18Lib.from(buffer))
49:             .mul(_etherPrice())
50:             .mul(UFixed18.wrap(block.basefee));
51: 
52:         _raiseKeeperFee(keeperFee, data);
53: 
54:         keeperToken().push(msg.sender, keeperFee);
55: 
56:         emit KeeperCall(msg.sender, gasUsed, multiplier, buffer, keeperFee);
57:     }

```

## Impact
 Keepers would get no enough premium or even lead to loss  while depeg occurs.

## Recommendation
Using chainlink ````USDC/USD```` feed to calculate accurate DSU amount.
