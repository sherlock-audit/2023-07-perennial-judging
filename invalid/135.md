# Market.sol : `claimReward` need to have reentrancy protection, since the state update is done after making the external call.

`Market.sol` has [claimReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L154C28-L154C37) external function. Any valid user can  claim any available reward which is accrued.
But it updates the state after making the transfer. This is dangerous since it opens for reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets look at the [claimReward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L154C28-L154C37) function,

```solidity
    function claimReward() external {
        Local memory newLocal = _locals[msg.sender].read();


        reward.push(msg.sender, UFixed18Lib.from(newLocal.reward)); ------------->>> transfer the reward to msg.sender
        emit RewardClaimed(msg.sender, newLocal.reward);


        newLocal.reward = UFixed6Lib.ZERO; ------------------------->>> reset to zero after the push call.
        _locals[msg.sender].store(newLocal);
    }
```
## Impact

The call re-entered before updating the state till the funds are drained out.
