# PythOracle: Keeper can commit selected favourable price from 3-second range prices

Anyone can commit prices to PythOracle as long as the price is falling into the valid time range. A market user can select and commit prices in valid range that is favourable to him. This will make the protocol to have biased oracle prices and may profit the attacker and cause loses to others.

## Vulnerability Detail

The price is queried from Pyth with `_validateAndGetPrice`. The `updateData` is queried offchain from Pyth's api.

```solidity
    function commitRequested(uint256 versionIndex, bytes calldata updateData)
        public
        payable
        keep(KEEPER_REWARD_PREMIUM, KEEPER_BUFFER, "")
    {
        ....
        PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = _validateAndGetPrice(versionToCommit, updateData);
        ....
        _recordPrice(versionToCommit, pythPrice);
        ....
    }

    function _validateAndGetPrice(uint256 oracleVersion, bytes calldata updateData) private returns (PythStructs.Price memory price) {
        bytes[] memory updateDataList = new bytes[](1);
        updateDataList[0] = updateData;
        bytes32[] memory idList = new bytes32[](1);
        idList[0] = id;

        return pyth.parsePriceFeedUpdates{value: pyth.getUpdateFee(updateDataList)}(
            updateDataList,
            idList,
            SafeCast.toUint64(oracleVersion + MIN_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION),
            SafeCast.toUint64(oracleVersion + MAX_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION)
        )[0].price;
    }
```

The `updateData` will be decoded, validated and extracted to produce the queried oracle price inside `parsePriceFeedUpdates`.

As long as the price timestamp inside `updateData` falls into the range between `oracleVersion + MIN_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION` and `oracleVersion + MAX_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION`, it is considered valid.

Currently the MIN_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION is 12 and MAX_VALID_TIME_AFTER_VERSION is 15, so the range is 3 seconds. This is a large range for a perpetual protocol.

The attacker can query all the `updateData` in side this range from Pyth's api and select the favourable to commit.

## Impact

By selecting and commiting biased price will unlikely profit the attacker. But by continuously committing biased prices, there will be accumulated effects on funding fees and user position PnLs.

3 second is too large. Shrink range.
