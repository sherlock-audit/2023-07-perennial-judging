# The _loadPendingPositions call ignores pending withdrawals. Attackers could withdraw more than available collateral.
## Summary
_loadPendingPositions loops through the pending positions to calculate fees and keeper rewards, but it does not consider any pending withdrawals. The available collateralAfterFees is returned without subtracting pending withdrawals.
This allows attackers to make a withdrawal request greater than their actual available collateral, while the invariant check will still pass by ignoring those pending withdrawals.

_loadPendingPositions only loads the pending deposit positions when checking collateralization, not pending withdrawals. Withdrawals happen immediately when update() is called via the token.pull() call. But withdrawals are not reflected in _loadPendingPositions.


## Vulnerability Detail 
The _loadPendingPositions function returns collateralAfterFees, which is initialized to the account's current collateral  [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L555)
It then loops through the pending positions and subtracts the fees:  [Link2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L553-L558)

However, it does not account for any pending withdrawals on the account. So if an attacker had initiated a withdrawal in a previous transaction that had not yet been processed, that pending withdrawal amount would not be subtracted from the available collateral.

- This means an attacker could:
- Deposit a large amount of collateral via update().
- Immediately call update() again to withdraw even more collateral.
- _loadPendingPositions would not account for the pending withdrawal, so it would still see the large deposit.
- The invariant check would therefore pass, allowing the over-withdrawal.

## Impact
Attackers can drain collateral funds from the contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- _loadPendingPositions should also load pending withdrawal positions and account for them properly in the collateral calculation.
- Invariant check should happen before any token transfers occur in update().
- Add a re-entrancy guard to update() to prevent withdrawing again before pending withdrawals are processed.
