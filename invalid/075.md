# Inadequate Position Limit Calculation can lead to unintended position sizes.
the minimum and maximum position sizes are calculated based on the currentAccountPosition and currentPosition values, which are derived from external data sources. An attacker could potentially manipulate these external data sources or parameters to affect the calculation of position limits, allowing them to exceed the intended limits or manipulate the behavior of the strategy.
## Vulnerability Detail
see the summary.
here is the vulnerable part of code : 
```solidity
 /// @notice Compute the position limit of a market
    /// @param context The context of the market
    /// @return The minimum position size before crossing the net position
    /// @return The maximum position size before crossing the maker limit
    function _positionLimit(MarketContext memory context) private pure returns (UFixed6, UFixed6) {
        return (
            // minimum position size before crossing the net position
            context.currentAccountPosition.maker.sub(
                context.currentPosition.maker
                    .sub(context.currentPosition.net().min(context.currentPosition.maker))
                    .min(context.currentAccountPosition.maker)
            ),
            // maximum position size before crossing the maker limit
            context.currentAccountPosition.maker.add(
                context.riskParameter.makerLimit
                    .sub(context.currentPosition.maker.min(context.riskParameter.makerLimit))
            )
        );
    }
}
```
## Impact
 the incorrect calculation in the _positionLimit function, the minimum position size before crossing the net position may be erroneously determined. This could lead to incorrect position limit enforcement, allowing positions to be established or increased beyond what is intended by the risk parameters. This can result in unintended and potentially risky positions, disrupting the expected behavior of the strategy and exposing the system to vulnerabilities related to risk management.

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
my advise is to  ensure that the calculated position limits align with the strategy's risk management goals.
