# MultiInvoker will not be able to commit sevral prices to the oracle
MultiInvoker will not be able to commit sevral prices to the oracle.
## Vulnerability Detail
MultiInvoker can be used to execute several actions in same tx.
It's possible that keeper would like to execute [commit price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L300-L307) several times. This action [sends all `msg.value`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-extensions/contracts/MultiInvoker.sol#L303) with the call to the oracle.
Because of that all amount is sent along with the first call and another one will revert as there will be no payment for the oracle data check.
## Impact
Several commit prices will not work.
