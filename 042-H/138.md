# New orders should request for a new oracle version at `currentTimestamp` (the next whole hour) instead of the current time (`block.timestamp`)

## Vulnerability Detail

`Oracle#request()` will be called whenever the user creates a new order. However, in the current implementation, while it records the `oracles[global.current].timestamp` as the `currentTimestamp` returned from the oracle provider's `status()` function (which should be the next whole hour time), the actual price/version requested was the current time (`block.timestamp`) instead.

For example, an order created at 10:24 records the `oracles[global.current].timestamp` as 11:00 but the actual requested price update time is 10:24.

Unless there is an order submitted at 11:00, this order will most certainly be invalidated.

Or maybe someone will call `PythOracle#commit()` to deliberately commit the price for 11:00, but this function is disincentivized. Only the requested price will get the keeper fee.

## Impact

Almost all orders will get invalidated.

## Recommendation

New orders should request a price update at `currentTimestamp` (the next whole hour). A `settlementFee` should only be charged when it is the first request to that timestamp.
