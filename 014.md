# _etherPrice() inside of Kept can return stale price, causing loss to keeper
## Summary

Inside of the Kept contract, which is used to calculate a keeper feel for executing trades, uses .latestRoundData() which might be stale.
In this case the fee will be calculated incorrectly and it may not incentivize keepers anymore to execute trades.

## Vulnerability Detail

The keep() modifer of kept contract call _etherPrice(), which calls ethTokenOrcaleFeed().latestRoundData():

```solidity
    /// @notice Returns the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    /// @return The price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
    function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {
        (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
        return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); // chainlink eth-usd feed uses 8 decimals
    }
```

This can return a stale price, resulting in loss to keeper who executes the trade.

## Impact

With stale data returned from an oracle, it may not be profitable anymore to execute trades, this will lead to loss for keeper when executing trades.

## Recommendation

Pay fee in native token, or implement checks to avoid stale price.
