# Updating market parameters like leverage could instantly liquidate positions
## Summary
There is a risk of instant liquidation when updating market parameters like leverage in the Vault contract.
The issue occurs in the updateMarket() function

## Vulnerability Detail 
[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/Vault.sol#L164) the market's leverage is directly set to a new value.
If the newLeverage is drastically lower than the current leverage, it could put the Vault's position on that market underwater.
For example:
1. Vault has 1 ETH collateral on Market A
2. Market A has 10x leverage, so Vault has 10 ETH in position
3. Market A price is $1000, so Vault has $10,000 in position value
4. Owner calls updateMarket to lower leverage to 5x
5. Now Vault's 1 ETH collateral only supports 5 ETH position
6. But Vault still has 10 ETH position open, this is now underwater 5 ETH
7. Vault will get liquidated on next update call


## Impact
It could put the Vault's position on that market underwater
