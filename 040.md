# Incorrect calculation in `convertToAssets`

## Summary
The calculaton for `convertToAssets` can get a wrong value

## Vulnerability Detail
The `convertToAssets` function in the `perennial-v2\packages\perennial-vault\contracts\Vault.sol` contract has an incorrect calculation. This can lead to users having wrong shares in their account. The `convertToAssets` function converts a given amount of shares to assets. The calculation is as follows:

```solidity
(UFixed6 _totalAssets, UFixed6 _totalShares) = (UFixed6Lib.from(totalAssets().max(Fixed6Lib.ZERO)), totalShares());
return _totalShares.isZero() ? shares : shares.muldiv(_totalAssets, _totalShares);
```

The problem is with the `_totalShares.isZero()` check. This check should be `_totalAssets.isZero()`.

If `_totalShares` is zero, then the user has no shares. In this case, the correct calculation is to return the number of shares that were passed in. However, the current calculation returns the total assets in the contract, which is wrong.

If `_totalAssets` is zero, then the contract has no assets. In this case, the correct calculation is to return zero. However, the current calculation returns the number of shares that were passed in, which is also wrong.

The correct calculation should be as follows:

```solidity
(UFixed6 _totalAssets, UFixed6 _totalShares) = (UFixed6Lib.from(totalAssets().max(Fixed6Lib.ZERO)), totalShares());
return _totalAssets.isZero() ? 0 : shares.muldiv(_totalAssets, _totalShares);
```

This ensures that the correct amount of assets is returned, regardless of whether the total shares or total assets in the contract are zero.

### Proof of Concept 
Here is an example of how the incorrect calculation can lead to users having wrong shares in their account:

1. Suppose the total assets in the contract are 100.
2. Suppose the user has 50 shares.
3. The user calls the `convertToAssets` function with 25 shares.
4. The incorrect calculation will return 25, which is the number of shares that were passed in.
5. However, the correct calculation would return 12.5, which is the amount of assets that the user should have received.

This means that the user would have 25 shares in their account, but they would only have 12.5 assets.

## Impact
The incorrect calculation in `convertToAssets` could lead to users having wrong shares in their account. This could result in users losing money or being unable to withdraw their assets.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Correct the calculation by doing this:
```solidity
function convertToAssets(UFixed6 shares) external view returns (UFixed6) {
        (UFixed6 _totalAssets, UFixed6 _totalShares) = (UFixed6Lib.from(totalAssets().max(Fixed6Lib.ZERO)), totalShares());
        return _totalAssets.isZero() ? shares : shares.muldiv(_totalAssets, _totalShares);
    }
```
This will ensure that the correct amount of assets is returned, regardless of whether the total shares or total assets in the contract are zero.
