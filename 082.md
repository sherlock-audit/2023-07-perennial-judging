# the _update function is vulnerable to an attacker draining funds from arbitrary accounts
## Summary
The key issue is that _update does not verify that msg.sender matches the account parameter being updated
## Vulnerability Detail 
The collateral update happens unconditionally, regardless of who called the function.
An attacker could exploit this by:
1.	Calling _update with a victim's address as the account parameter
2.	Setting a negative collateral amount to drain funds
This would drain funds from the victim's account even though the msg.sender is the attacker.


## Impact
The impact is that an attacker could arbitrarily drain funds from any user's account.
