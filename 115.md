# Multi invoker does not allow users to liquidate a position without liquidation fee
## Summary
Multi invoker does not allow users to liquidate a position without liquidation fee.
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in updated mechanism document, now users have a option to liquidate a position without liquidation fee (value = 0). However, there is no such option when users issue liquidation command via batch command (multi invoker).
## Impact
Users who wish to liquidate their own positions to preserve their balance will have to deposit again, paying more gas and settlement fee.
