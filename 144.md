# Suden price change can result in collateral shortfall and bad debt
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When the time comes that the price suddenly drops ("flash crash") or a special occurrence happens where the entire blockchain experiences downtime (happened to [OP](https://status.optimism.io/clieqyc0x13645trowwikfepm3), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/blog/lessons-learned-from-recent-outage-of-polygon-pos-2), [Arbitrum](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), and [BSC](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1578152039455916033)), resulting in an inevitable sudden price change, one price update may result in a major shortfall on some of the positions, which means bad debt.

## PoC

Given:

There are only two users, one with a long position and another one with a short position:

- long: 10, collateral: 100
- short: 10, collateral: 100
- maker: 0
- price: 5

When:

1. The price suddenly rises to 20
2. PNL to long: 10 * 15 == 150, PNL to short: -150
3. After the settlements, the collateral amount of the long user the book will become 250 and -50 for the short user.

## Impact

The last users won't be able to withdraw their funds when the real balance is running low, so there will be a bank run.

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a new Gradual settlement method that handles sudden price changes.

By splitting the large change into multiple smaller price change settlements, each one should not exceed a certain percentage of change corresponding to the `riskParameter.maintenance` of the market.

For example, a price change from 5 to 10 can be split into 5 -> 6, 6 -> 7, 7 -> 8, 8 -> 9, 9 -> 10.

Each settlement should also close/liquidate positions with negative collateral.
