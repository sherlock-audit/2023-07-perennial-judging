# Collateral removal user action doesn't require oracle price and doesn't trigger oracle request to commit new oracle version, which can be used to front-run price updates to gain unfair advantage and profit at the expense of the other protocol users
## Summary

All user actions trigger oracle version request and can only proceed when settled with the correct oracle price. However, there is an exception: if the action only changes collateral, it is allowed to just proceed using the most recent commited oracle price available. This is a high security risk, because collateral removal can be used as "closing position" with a fee = maintaince margin. This allows to basically front-run large oracle updates, closing positions at lagging old prices. For example:
1. Alice opens 1 ETH Long position at price = $1000
2. At some later time the last commited price is $1100
3. Current price instantly drops to $1080, however it is not yet commited, so the last commited price is still $1100.
4. Instead of closing position (which will happen later at the current price of $1080 or worse), Alice can just remove max collateral available at the last commited price ($1100), keeping only the minimum required. If leverage = 100, Alice can keep $11 as collateral and withdraw $89 of profit, abandoning her position. This is equal to closing position with a fee = 1% of position notional (at the price of $1089, which is much better than the current market price).
5. Additionally, Alice can also immediately liquidate her own account (as it will be in a bad debt once the current price is commited) to get additional liquidation fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

All `Market.update()` calls request a new oracle version and add the changes to a pending position, **except** collateral update:
```solidity
        // request version
        if (!newOrder.isEmpty()) oracle.request(account);
```
Order is empty when maker, long and short are all zero (and since order is a change in user position, it's empty when position is left untouched).

Collateral is also deposited/sent to caller immediately:
```solidity
    function _update(
...
        // fund
        if (collateral.sign() == 1) token.pull(msg.sender, UFixed18Lib.from(collateral.abs()));
        if (collateral.sign() == -1) token.push(msg.sender, UFixed18Lib.from(collateral.abs()));
```

As shown in the scenario above, collateral removal can be used as a form of closing position by abandoning it, effectively bypassing the normal logic flow for all position changes, even if the bypassing "fee" is rather high (maintaince margin).

## Impact

Any user can front-run large oracle updates to gain unfair profit, put his account into a bad debt and liquidate his own account for additional profit - all at the expense of the other protocol users, effectively stealing from the protocol.

The only condition of this to happen is for the last commited price to lag the current price by maintaince margin or more. If maintaince margin is 1% (leverage = 100), this means just 1% of price lag is enough, which is easily possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

While immediate collateral deposit doesn't possess any risk and can be allowed, immediate collateral removal creates a high security risk, and while it's convenient for the user, for the sake of security it should also go through the pending state and be confirmed with a fresh oracle version before being sent to user as all the other position updates.
