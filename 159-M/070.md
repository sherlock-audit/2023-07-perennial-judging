# Oracle stale price is not checked, only 1 oracle is used
## Summary

The `keep` modifier in the `Kept` contract incentivizes keepers to call a function by providing them with a fee. However, there are some potential security concerns that should be addressed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `keep` modifier calculates the `keeperFee` based on the gas used in the function call, a multiplier, a buffer, the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token, and the base fee of the block. While this approach is generally fine, there are a few areas that need attention:

1. The `keeperFee` calculation relies on the `_etherPrice` function, which fetches the latest price of ETH from the `ethTokenOracleFeed`. However, there is no check to ensure that the price is recent enough. This could result in the contract using stale prices, which may lead to incorrect fee calculations.
    1. _etherPrice uses only a single Oracle, which may go offline. It is preferred to use price info from at least 2 sources. For instance Chainlink and Uniswap TWAP.

## Impact

Stale/invalid prices from the `ethTokenOracleFeed` can lead to incorrect fee calculations, resulting in keepers being rewarded with inaccurate amounts.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Placed on a functon to incentivize keepers to call it
/// @param multiplier The multiplier to apply to the gas used
/// @param buffer The fixed gas amount to add to the gas used
/// @param data Arbitrary data to pass to the _raiseKeeperFee function
modifier keep(UFixed18 multiplier, uint256 buffer, bytes memory data) {
    uint256 startGas = gasleft();

    _;

    uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft();
    UFixed18 keeperFee = UFixed18Lib.from(gasUsed)
        .mul(multiplier)
        .add(UFixed18Lib.from(buffer))
        .mul(_etherPrice())
        .mul(UFixed18.wrap(block.basefee));

    _raiseKeeperFee(keeperFee, data);

    keeperToken().push(msg.sender, keeperFee);

    emit KeeperCall(msg.sender, gasUsed, multiplier, buffer, keeperFee);
}

/// @notice Returns the price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
/// @return The price of ETH in terms of the keeper token
function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {
    (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
    return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); // chainlink eth-usd feed uses 8 decimals
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address the potential security concerns:

1. Implement a freshness check for the price fetched from the `ethTokenOracleFeed` to ensure that only recent prices are used. This can be done by checking the `updatedAt` value provided by the `latestRoundData()` function.
2. Add another source for the price data. For instance Uniswap TWAP.
