# Not checking the staleness of the price from latestRoundData
Not checking the staleness of the price from latestRoundData
## Vulnerability Detail
None of the oracle calls check for stale prices
## Impact
Oracle price feeds can become stale due to a variety of [reasons](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/133242/how-future-resilient-is-a-chainlink-price-feed/133843#133843). Using a stale price will result in incorrect calculations in most of the key functionality
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Read the updatedAt parameter from the calls to latestRoundData() and verify that it isn't older than a set amount, e.g.:
if (updatedAt < block.timestamp - 60 * 60 /* 1 hour */) {
   revert("stale price feed");
}
