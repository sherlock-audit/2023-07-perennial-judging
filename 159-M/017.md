# Kept contract doesn't check ether price from feed
Kept contract doesn't check ether price from feed
## Vulnerability Detail
Kept contract has `keep` modifier, which should calculate amount of DSU that keeper should receive for execution.
I uses [chainlink price feed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/root/contracts/attribute/Kept.sol#L62) to get price.

The problem is that function doesn't check if price is stale or invalid, it just uses it as it is. Because of that it's possible that wrong price will be used to calculate reward.
## Impact
Wrong price can be used

## Recommendation
Check returned prices to be valid and not stale.
