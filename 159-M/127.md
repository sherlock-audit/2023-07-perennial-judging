# Result from Chainlink oracle price is not checked for validity
## Summary

Chainlink oracle price is not checked for validity.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Kept contract, the ETH price is retrieved from Chainlink oracle to calculate the keeper fee.

        (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();

However, the price is not sufficiently validated. The `updatedAt` result is ignored and is not checked with a threshold to ensure the price is not too old.

## Impact

The stale price will lead to incorrect keeper fee calculation.

## Recommendation

Add a checking

```diff
        function _etherPrice() private view returns (UFixed18) {
-           (, int256 answer, , ,) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
+           (uint80 roundID, int256 answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = ethTokenOracleFeed().latestRoundData();
+           require(answer > 0,"Negative Price");
+           require(block.timestamp <= updatedAt + stalePriceDelay, "Stale price");
            return UFixed18Lib.from(Fixed18Lib.ratio(answer, 1e8)); 
        }
```
