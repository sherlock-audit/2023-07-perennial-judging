# Keepers will continue earning rewards for commiting prices even when the protocol is paused
## Summary

Keepers will continue earning rewards for commiting prices even when the protocol is paused

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `PythOracle::commit` is called by keepers to commit prices:

```solidity
    function commit(uint256 oracleVersion, bytes calldata updateData) external payable {
        // Must be before the next requested version to commit, if it exists
        // Otherwise, try to commit it as the next request version to commit
        if (versionList.length > nextVersionIndexToCommit && oracleVersion >= versionList[nextVersionIndexToCommit]) {
            commitRequested(nextVersionIndexToCommit, updateData);
            return;
        }

        PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = _validateAndGetPrice(oracleVersion, updateData);

        // Oracle version must be more recent than those of the most recently committed version
        if (oracleVersion <= _latestVersion) revert PythOracleVersionTooOldError();

        _recordPrice(oracleVersion, pythPrice);
        _latestVersion = oracleVersion;
    }
```

The keepers are given a reward as can be seen from the `keep` modifer:

```solidity
    modifier keep(UFixed18 multiplier, uint256 buffer, bytes memory data) {
        uint256 startGas = gasleft();

        _;

        uint256 gasUsed = startGas - gasleft();
        UFixed18 keeperFee = UFixed18Lib.from(gasUsed)
            .mul(multiplier)
            .add(UFixed18Lib.from(buffer))
            .mul(_etherPrice())
            .mul(UFixed18.wrap(block.basefee));

        _raiseKeeperFee(keeperFee, data);

        keeperToken().push(msg.sender, keeperFee);

        emit KeeperCall(msg.sender, gasUsed, multiplier, buffer, keeperFee);
    }
```

When the protocol is paused, keepers are still able to continue commiting prices and earning rewards.
If the protocol is paused for a long time, the protocol would lose a substantial amount of funds in payment to keepers.

## Impact

Keepers earn rewards for commiting prices at periods where the prices are not needed by the protocol. The protocol would keep unnecessarily paying keepers.
