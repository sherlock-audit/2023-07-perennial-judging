# Out of Gas error will occur if too many markets are registered to a vault
## Summary

Out of Gas error will occur if too many markets are registered to a vault

## Vulnerability Detail

If too many markets are registered to a vault, vault functionality would be broken due to gas exhaustion.
In the function `Vault::_register`, the number of markets registered will continue to increase with `totalMarkets` incremented without an upper bound.

```solidity
    /// @notice Handles the registration for a new market
    /// @param market The market to register
    function _register(IMarket market) private {
        if (!IVaultFactory(address(factory())).marketFactory().instances(market)) revert VaultNotMarketError();
        if (!market.token().eq(asset)) revert VaultIncorrectAssetError();

        asset.approve(address(market));

        uint256 newMarketId = totalMarkets++;
        _registrations[newMarketId].store(Registration(market, 0, UFixed6Lib.ZERO));
        emit MarketRegistered(newMarketId, market);
    }
```

The issue is there is no upper bound set and this could lead to a scenario where the number of markets becomes high enough to cause gas exhaustion due to the way certain for loops are implemented.

 Various functions including `Vault::vlaimReward`, `Vault::_settleUnderlying`, `Vault::_manage`, `Vault::_loadContext`, `Vault::_collateral` would all be impacted.

In addition, the number of loops is amplified in a function such as `Vault::update` which calls multiple functions which have loops in them. 

```solidity
    function update(
        address account,
        UFixed6 depositAssets,
        UFixed6 redeemShares,
        UFixed6 claimAssets
    ) external whenNotPaused {
        _settleUnderlying();
        Context memory context = _loadContext(account);

        _settle(context);
        _checkpoint(context);
        _update(context, account, depositAssets, redeemShares, claimAssets);
        _saveContext(context, account);
    }
```

## Impact

The vault would be broken with multiple functionality disabled.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set an upper bound on the `totalMarkets` value
