# PAUSER CAN'T PAUSE / UNPAUSE AFTER `updatePause()` FUNCTION USED.
## Summary
Functions with `onlyPauser` modifier in `Pausable.sol` contract will always throw after owner updated the pauser.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the natspec section of the `onlyPauser` modifier says that it `Throws if called by any account other than the pauser`, 
but there is another condition `_sender() != owner()` that must be met.

```solidity
/// @dev Throws if called by any account other than the pauser
modifier onlyPauser {
    if (_sender() != pauser() && _sender() != owner()) revert UPausableNotPauserError(_sender());
    _;
}
```
## Impact

Let's imagine the situation. The owner of the contract decide to update the pauser and use `updatePauser()` function.
A new pauser now can't pause / unpause the contract due to condition that pauser != owner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove `_sender() != owner()` condition.

```solidity
/// @dev Throws if called by any account other than the pauser
modifier onlyPauser {
    if (_sender() != pauser()) revert UPausableNotPauserError(_sender());
    _;
}
```
