# ETH sent to PythOracle.sol#commit function will be lost forever.
The `PythOracle.sol#commit` function is `payable` but has no implementation for ETher refund and the contract does not also have a withdraw function to withdraw all Ether sent to the contract through `PythOracle.sol#commit` and `PythOracle.sol#commitRequest` functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `PythOracle.sol#commit` function is `payable` but has no implementation for ETher refund and the contract does not also have a withdraw function to withdraw all Ether sent to the contract.

## Impact
All Ether sent to the `payable` function `PythOracle.sol#commit` will be lost forever.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-07-perennial/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/pyth/PythOracle.sol#L164

```solidity
function commit(uint256 oracleVersion, bytes calldata updateData) external payable {
        // Must be before the next requested version to commit, if it exists
        // Otherwise, try to commit it as the next request version to commit
        if (versionList.length > nextVersionIndexToCommit && oracleVersion >= versionList[nextVersionIndexToCommit]) {
            commitRequested(nextVersionIndexToCommit, updateData);
            return;
        }

        PythStructs.Price memory pythPrice = _validateAndGetPrice(oracleVersion, updateData);

        // Oracle version must be more recent than those of the most recently committed version
        if (oracleVersion <= _latestVersion) revert PythOracleVersionTooOldError();

        _recordPrice(oracleVersion, pythPrice);
        _latestVersion = oracleVersion;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `payable` keyword from the `commit` and `commitReward` functions if ETH is not required for their execution.
