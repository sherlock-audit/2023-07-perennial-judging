# `Liquidation` should not put the market into a worse state (more bad debt).
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`LiquidationFee` should not exceed the total collateral of the position because that would mean that the market is paying for the liquidation with system-wide bad debt and putting the market in a worse state.

In the current implementation, `liquidationFee` is a percentage based on the size of the position (bounded by `minLiquidationFee` and `maxLiquidationFee`). In normal circumstances, this should work without causing any trouble. However, when the time comes that the price suddenly drops ("flash crash") or a special occurrence happens where the entire blockchain experiences downtime (happened to [OP](https://status.optimism.io/clieqyc0x13645trowwikfepm3), [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/blog/lessons-learned-from-recent-outage-of-polygon-pos-2), [Arbitrum](https://offchain.medium.com/todays-arbitrum-sequencer-downtime-what-happened-6382a3066fbc), and [BSC](https://twitter.com/BNBCHAIN/status/1578152039455916033)), resulting in an inevitable sudden price change, liquidations that result in shortfalls will become possible and result in an increase of system bad debt.

## PoC

Given:

There are only two users, one with a long position and another one with a short position:

- long: 10, collateral: 100
- short: 10, collateral: 100
- maker: 0
- price: 8

When:

1. The price suddenly rises to 18
2. PNL to long: 10 * 10 == 100, PNL to short: -100
3. While the remaining collateral of the short user is 0, liquidation will take a fee and incur a bad debt which will result in the long user being unable to redeem all the profits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Based on the fact that the liquidation will most certainly be executed by the bots and for the bots, as long as the return to execute a transaction is greater than the gas cost, they would do it without complaining about the low margin.

A better design is to ask for a fixed amount of liquidation deposit denominated in the native token when opening the account for the first time (similar to GMX, MakerDAO, Liquity), and combine it with a portion of the remaining collateral, but never go beyond and cause any bad debt.
